# BingAdsAuthentication
A web application demonstrating Bing Ads authentication, this is based on the methods in my post [here](https://blog.bitscry.com/2018/12/05/accessing-the-bing-ads-api-in-a-console-application/) and is used as a way to retrieve a long lasting refresh token.

In order for this to work you need to add a web platform to your [app registration](https://apps.dev.microsoft.com) and point the redirect and logout URLs to your site e.g. https://localhost:44384/Home/Redirect.
